# A simple RestAPI implemented in Rust
## Nothing major, just a small project to learn the basics of web development and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
### This RestAPI provides a 2D array of random booleans (represented as one's and zeros) based on the "columns" and "rows" specified in the URL.
